# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

# Making new migrations

It's really important to run this command when you make prisma schema changes
```
prisma migrate dev --name <name>
```

This makes a new migration under the prisma/migrations folder with the name appended to the folder.
These migrations are run in order depending on the time prefix. 

We're running migrations with the `prisma migrate deploy` as part of the build step in the CI. So, this means that
all we need to do is make sure that these migrations are backwards compatible and can be applied in the CI.
